# Mastercard---Cybersecurity-Job-Semulation

### Task One

I was working as an analyst in the Mastercard Security Awareness Team, I played a crucial role in helping the staff at Mastercard learn how to identify and report security threats. One of the most common threats we face today is phishing.

Phishing is the act of pretending to be someone or something to obtain sensitive information, such as passwords. Attackers often send links or attachments designed to infect the recipient's system with malicious software or trick them into providing financial information, system credentials, or other sensitive data. Successful phishing attempts can cost companies like Mastercard millions of dollars and put our employees at risk. That’s why it’s vital to keep our business and staff safe from harm.

At Mastercard, they take proactive steps to mitigate phishing threats by educating our people about the risks and how to recognize them. One effective way they build awareness is through phishing simulation campaigns. Each month, they test their staff by sending a fake phishing email that mimics what a bad actor would send. They then analyze the results of these simulated tests to help design and implement future training.

By continuing to raise awareness and improve our security practices, we can better protect ourselves and our organization from these threats.

My task was to create a believable phishing email for Mastercard’s next phishing simulation campaign. This was an awesome opportunity for me to step up and show what I can do.

##### What I learned
1. What threat phishing presents to an organization 
2. What different types of phishing emails look like
3. How Mastercard prevents and mitigates phishing threat

### Task Two

The phishing simulation I designed in the first task was run last week. So, what’s next?

They used some tools to analyze the results, and it’s clear that certain departments have a higher failure rate than others—some teams are more likely to fall for a phishing email.

Now that they have these results, the next steps are to:

1. Identify which areas of the business need more awareness about phishing.
2. Design and implement targeted training for those teams to reduce the risk of a real attack
